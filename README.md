### Web Page Generator
This project utilizes the tkinter module and creates a gui with a scrolling text box where
the user can input changes to an html webpage.  When the user submits the changes, the updated
page is opened in a new tab in the default browser.


### Student Tracking
The tkinter module was used to create a GUI that allows a user to enter information about a student into
a database.  The current list of students is displayed in a textbox with a scrollbar, and the user is able to add and delete 
items from the list.

### Phonebook
This project creates a GUI using tkinter that allows the user to add, update, and delete entries in a phone book.  A list of current entries is displayed.

### Django Checkbook
This application created using Django tracks faux bank accounts.  Users can create new accounts, enter transancations, and view their balance sheets.
